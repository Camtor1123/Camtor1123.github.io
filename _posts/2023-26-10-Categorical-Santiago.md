Santiago is known for its very high altitude mountains, the Cordillera de los Andes, as well as its smaller but no less important hills, Cerro San Cristobal and Cerro Santa Lucia. In these high altitudes live the condors important bird of the civiliation near the Andes. The incas and it feature in many different simboligy throught these civilizations. If we adopt the point of view of the condors, the details leaves the main scene and the relationships between the object take the spotlight. Thus, we can interpret this from a categorical point of view of Santiago. In this post, we are going to explore and explain some of these high points.

Cerro Santa Lucia, which relative height (prominance) is 68 meters. This is not a very high hill compare with it neighboor height San Cristobal which relative height is 280 meters. But what it lacks in altitude, it has in attitude. On this one could fine ermites, cannons,  multiple statues, fountains, castle, etc.  All in 65.300 square metters. One can find all these in the ¨Album de Santa Lucia¨.

This hill has been not always this glamourous, actually the natives called it Huelen, which means melancholy, sadness or pain. This inflexion point was possible thanks to Benjamin Vicuña Mackenna desidend to bring this philosophy to Santiago. Among ones of this signature was the acondicianamiento de del Cerro Santa Lucia in his own words "that threefold marvel of nature, history, and urban life yearned for a common laborer who could envision its transformation into a cornerstone of the modern metropolis". 

Of course, there are many places to visit in this hills, so we are only see some glimpses of the views you can have in Cerro Santa Lucia. It has different levels, but we will concentrate on the highest ones. From here we can look at Alameda the main street in Santiago. As such, on the street many activities happens demostration, politcal speech, sport events, etc. Beneath this street is Linea 1, also the spine of the metro system. It connects with all lines of the metro system (2023).

From this side we can see different building such as Iglesia and Museum. Bibloteca Nacional and Iglesia San Francisco. Finally our next destination, cerro San Cristobal.

Cerro San Cristobal. This is an iconic hill; it is a park with 722 hectares, one of the biggest in the world. This park is called Parquemet. It has Pools, cables cars, funiculars, a Zoo, botanical garden, a sanctuary, astronomical observatory, etc. Of course, due to the great extent of this hill, we are only going to highlight some of its high points. First, maybe the most well-known, the summit. It has a sculture of virgen maria. 

These are just two categorical views emerging from the hills of Santiago. We encourage the reader to explore these and discover new ones
