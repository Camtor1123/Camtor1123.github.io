<!--- In the historical center of Santiago, there is a mystery. In geographical origin of Santiago (and also the main due to its location relative to the sunsets) there is place where you can find the 0 Km, marking the. This has been the center of Santiago for a long time, but the modernity has brought new perspective to the City. One of the is the main highways of Santiago. Fearsome machines with high speed move people and goods through out the city. The bringer of the modernity with their new ideas, decided to create a new 0Km in Santiago. It is not clear from where these idea came from, but probably it has as its roots the noncommutative geometry. Commutative is maybe something that you has heard in the school, as a property of the numbers, more precisely you heard something along the line of: "the order of the sums does not alter the sum". Arguably, noncommutative is more natural, as many structure in the day to day life are noncommunicative, for examples the word alblabll is different from the one.
